                        Words spoken by Ani: 'O you Soul [ba], greatly majestic, behold, I have come that I may see you; I open the
                        Netherworld that I may see my father Osiris and drive away darkness, for I am beloved of him. I have come that I may see my
                        father Osiris and that I may cut out the heart of Seth who has harmed my father Osiris. I have opened up every path
                        which is in the sky and on earth, for I am the well-beloved son of my father Osiris. I am noble, I am a spirit [akh], I am
                        equipped; O all you gods and all you spirits [akhu], prepare a path for me.
